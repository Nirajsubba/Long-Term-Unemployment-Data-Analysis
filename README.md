Project Description: Long Term Unemployment Data Analysis
Introduction

This project analyzes long-term unemployment trends using Power BI to uncover patterns across demographics, time, and age groups. By presenting interactive visualizations, the dashboard provides decision-makers with an accessible way to understand unemployment dynamics and identify key areas of concern.

Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate unemployment trends over time, compare unemployment rates between genders, and identify which age groups are most affected. The dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, and business stakeholders use data-driven insights to develop effective strategies for reducing unemployment.

Analysis and Insights

Overall Unemployment: The dataset shows a total of 440M unemployed individuals.

Yearly Trends: Unemployment peaked at 78M in 2010 before declining to 6M in 2015, indicating significant improvement over time.

Gender Analysis: Women accounted for 55.61% of unemployment compared to 44.39% for men, revealing an 11.23% gender unemployment gap.

Age Group Insights: The 25–34 years group (95M) experienced the highest unemployment, followed by the 45–54 years group (91M). The lowest levels were found in the 16–19 years (26M) and 65+ years (29M) categories.

Monthly Trends: Seasonal variations were observed, with March (39M) having the highest unemployment and June (35.2M) the lowest.

Tools and Techniques

Visualization Tool: Microsoft Power BI

Methods: Time-series analysis, demographic segmentation, and gender-based comparison

Interactive Features: Filters for gender and age group to allow customized exploration

Conclusion

The Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of long-term unemployment trends. The analysis highlights critical insights, such as higher unemployment among women and young adults, as well as notable yearly and monthly variations. These findings can assist policymakers and organizations in targeting vulnerable groups, addressing gender disparities, and planning employment policies more effectively. Overall, the project demonstrates how data visualization can transform complex datasets into actionable insights for real-world decision-making.
